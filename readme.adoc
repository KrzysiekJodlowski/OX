- if you can't run a script first execute command like: *_chmod 755 standard.sh_* (or *_chmod 755 auto.sh_*)
- when running _"auto"_ script new folder with name matching DATE_TIME name in automata/output is created, inside that folder you can see effect of running the game with all provided default scenarios:
* draw
* "O" wins by matching first column
* "O" wins by matching second column

* "O" wins by matching second row
* "O" wins by matching third row
